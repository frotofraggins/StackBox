# StackPro Branching Strategy

## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE

### Branch Structure
- **main**: Production branch (protected)
- **develop**: Default development branch (protected)
- **feature/***: Feature branches (merge to develop)

### Protection Rules
- âœ… Both main and develop require PR reviews (1 approval)
- âœ… No direct pushes allowed to protected branches
- âœ… Stale reviews are dismissed on new commits

### Workflow
1. Create feature branch from develop: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Develop and commit changes
3. Push and create PR to develop
4. After approval, merge to develop (triggers staging deployment)
5. Create release PR from develop to main (triggers production deployment)

### Amplify Integration âœ… COMPLETE
- **Production**: main branch â†’ main.d3m3k3uuuvlvyv.amplifyapp.com
- **Staging**: develop branch â†’ develop.d3m3k3uuuvlvyv.amplifyapp.com âœ… DEPLOYED

### Next Steps âœ… COMPLETE
1. âœ… Configure Amplify staging environment for develop branch
2. Test the workflow with a feature branch
3. Verify staging deployments work correctly

**Status**: Professional branching strategy implemented successfully! ðŸš€
