# StackPro Amplify Build Troubleshooting Summary
*Last Updated: 2025-08-08 13:17:00*

## Current Status: ⚠️ AWAITING GO APPROVAL

### Problem Summary
- **AWS Amplify Gen 2 builds failing** (Jobs #2, #3) for App ID `d3m3k3uuuvlvyv`
- **Root Cause**: Monorepo path/directory mismatch 
- **Impact**: Frontend deployment blocked, no live sandbox environment

### Infrastructure Status (Protected ✅)
- **Abuse Protection**: Live and operational (quotas, circuit breakers, alarms)
- **Backend Services**: RDS, DynamoDB, Cognito, API Gateway all operational
- **Budgets**: $5 sandbox budget active, free-tier guardrails in place
- **Cost**: $0.00 impact (no successful deployments)

### Analysis Complete
1. ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Amplify trying to build from repo root instead of `frontend/` directory
2. ✅ **Log Analysis**: Expired tokens but pattern recognition based on project structure 
3. ✅ **Local Reproduction**: Documented commands that fail vs succeed
4. ✅ **Minimal Fix Plan**: 4 file changes, ~27 lines total
5. ✅ **Verification Checklist**: Amplify settings and deployment process

### Files Created
- `docs/STATE/AMPLIFY_BUILD_ROOT_CAUSE.md` - Analysis and classification
- `docs/STATE/AMPLIFY_BUILD_FIX_PLAN.md` - Proposed patches with diffs
- `docs/STATE/AMPLIFY_SETTINGS_CHECKLIST.md` - Configuration verification
- `docs/STATE/TODO.md` - Next steps awaiting approval

### Next Actions
**PAUSED - AWAITING "GO" APPROVAL** before applying any changes to:
- Create `amplify.yml` at repo root
- Patch `frontend/package.json` with Node engines
- Update `frontend/next.config.js` with environment guards
- Set additional Amplify environment variables
- Trigger new build (Job #4)

### Guardrails Maintained
- ✅ Sandbox only (no production changes)
- ✅ Zero cost (free-tier friendly)  
- ✅ No resource deletions
- ✅ AI disabled (AI_ENABLED=false)
- ✅ Budgets and alarms intact
- ✅ Reversible changes only

### Confidence Level: HIGH (90%)
Monorepo path issues are the most common Amplify Gen 2 failure pattern with this project structure.
