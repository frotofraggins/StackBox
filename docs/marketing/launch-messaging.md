### **Email Outreach (Cold)**
**Subject:** "20 minutes to professional client management?"

**Body:**
"Hi [Name],

Saw your [company] does great work in [industry]. Quick question:

How much time do you spend each week juggling between email, Dropbox, QuickBooks, and your website just to manage clients?

Most [industry] businesses tell us 5-8 hours/week.

StackPro combines all of that into one professional platform. Takes 20 minutes to set up, looks completely professional to your clients.

Worth a 15-minute demo to see if it could save you those 5-8 hours?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - 30-day free trial, no credit card required."
