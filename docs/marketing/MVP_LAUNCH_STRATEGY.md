Drowning in paperwork and client emails?

Just launched a tool specifically for trades - combines CRM, file sharing, and client communication in one place.

#### **Email Outreach (Cold)**
**Subject:** "20 minutes to professional client management?"

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Saw [company] does great work in [industry]. Quick question:

How much time do you spend weekly juggling email, Dropbox, QuickBooks, and your website just to manage clients?

Most [industry] businesses tell us 5-8 hours/week.

StackPro combines all that into one professional platform. 
20 minutes to set up, looks completely professional to clients.

Worth a 15-minute demo to save those 5-8 hours?

P.S. - 30-day free trial, no credit card required.
```
